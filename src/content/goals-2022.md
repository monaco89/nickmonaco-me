Since now that it's October I am starting to think about the goals I set for myself at the beginning of 2021. Going into 2022, I want to stay more focused and not procrastinate things that I have to/want to get done (like start this blog). This is kind of a 2021 introspective and 2022 planning into one post. For the programming side, I did find myself to be less focused by jumping around with multiple projects and not finishing what I started. As for the mental, physical, **LIFE** aspect of me, I wanted to lay a foundation to start building upon each year. The concept of "SMART" goals have been used mostly in a business setting, this is where I learned it but I thought it will be a good lesson to apply it to all my goals for the year.

What are **SMART** goals? The SMART acroynm is used to help guide goal setting. To make sure your goals are clear and reachable, each one should be:

- **S**pecific (simple, sensible, significant).
- **M**easurable (meaningful, motivating).
- **A**chievable (agreed, attainable).
- **R**elevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
- **T**ime bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

Coming up with goals that are not too vague is rather more difficult than I thought it would be. This list includes both professional and personal goals of mine and clearly it's still a work in progress...

- [ ] Contribute to an open source project via one pull request. Submit a PR for a bug/feature to a project that I use frequently.
- [ ] Learn a new technology/language and create a functional POC to lighlight its advantages and disadvantages.
- [ ] Complete one certification in software/scrum management.
- [ ] Implement at least 50% test coverage for my open source projects and codebases at work.
- [ ] Eat at every restaurant of my "DC Restaurants List".
- [ ] Hike/Explore every location on another DC list - top of list: Harpers Ferry, WV.
- [ ] Build the endurance to run 5 miles non-stop.
- [ ] Have a better understanding of Big O notation. (need to improve timing of this goal)
